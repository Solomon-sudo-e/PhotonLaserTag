## üì¶ Setup Instructions

### 0. Install Python 3 (if not already installed)
To install Python 3 on a Debian-based system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

### 1. Download & Navigate
Download the zip and extract to any location.

```bash
cd /path/to/project/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3 is installed, then run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-pip python3-pygame
python3 -m pip install pygubu pygame psycopg2-binary Pillow typing --break-system-packages
```
Yes, it does add the flag to break system packages. However, this is strictly to run the project, nothing else!

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

### Player Entry Screen
- Input **User ID** and **Equipment ID**.
- If the User ID exists in the database, the **Codename** will auto-fill.
- If not, leave the field blank and enter a new Codename manually.
- Press **F5** or click **Continue** to proceed to the match screen.
- Press **F12** or click **Clear All** to reset the form.

Each team supports **up to 15 players**. Teams are visually split (Green and Red).

### Game Screen
- See full team lineups and scores.
- Use **Start Game** to launch a 30-second countdown.
- After countdown, code `202` is sent over UDP to activate gear.
- Use **Back to Entry** to revise players (data auto-loads).

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Heads up!*
I could not find the way to access the database from the file yet, which I did not know was not required until today, so there is a "use_mock" parameter passed into the database initialization which will allow the users to use a local variable for in-memory gaming instead of the database for now!

## üîç Database Access
To view saved players:

```bash
psql photon
SELECT * FROM players;
```
